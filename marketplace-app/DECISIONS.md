# Architecture & Technical Decisions — marketplace-app

---

## ADR-001: All Vaadin UI consolidated in marketplace-app
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Two phases — (1) UI extracted from individual starters into a short-lived
`marketplace-ui` module; (2) `marketplace-ui` merged back into `marketplace-app` (no second
consumer existed, Maven module boundary added cost with no benefit) and domain logic moved to
dedicated starters.

**Decision:** All Vaadin UI lives in `marketplace-app` (`org.ost.marketplace.ui.*`). No starter
contains UI code. `marketplace-app` imports starters only via platform-commons contracts
(`UserPort`, `AdvertisementPort`, `AuditPort`, `AttachmentPort`, `UserDto`, etc.).
`*HookImpl` and `*PortImpl` orchestrators live in `marketplace-app`.

**Consequences:** CSS rule: all CSS lives in `marketplace-app/src/main/frontend/themes/my-app/`
— Vaadin 25 Vite build does not include CSS from `@CssImport` in JAR starters.

---

## ADR-002: No JPA / no Hibernate — JdbcClient + inline SQL
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** JPA/Hibernate introduces hidden lazy-loading bugs, N+1 queries, and magic that
conflicts with the "explicit over implicit" architecture principle.

**Decision:** All database access via `JdbcClient` with SQL inlined directly in repository methods.
`CrudRepository<T, Long>` only for trivial `save`/`findById`/`deleteById` — never for custom queries.

**Consequences:** Rejected: Spring Data JPA — too much hidden magic.

---

## ADR-003: Inline SQL repository style — no descriptor layer
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** A prior `SqlEntityDescriptor` / `SqlCommand` descriptor layer required jumping to
constants classes to read any query.

**Decision:** SQL inline per method — text block `"""..."""` for multi-line, single-line string
otherwise. No `TABLE`, `ALIAS`, `SOURCE`, or single-use SQL string constants.
- `@SuppressWarnings("java:S1192")` on every repository class.
- `MapSqlParameterSource` constructed inline per method.
- Dynamic SQL assembled with `.formatted()`, never `+` concatenation.
- `SqlFilterBuilder.build(params, filter, prefix)` — prefix is part of the call.
- `OrderByBuilder.build(sort, map)` returns `" ORDER BY ..."` with leading space.

**Consequences:** The Descriptor layer (`SqlEntityDescriptor`, `SqlCommand`, `SqlDescriptorField`,
`SqlEntityProjection`, `SqlFixedQuery`, `RepositoryCustom`) fully removed from the codebase.
When adding a new repository method, write the full SQL inline. Never extract a SQL fragment to
a constant unless shared across 3+ methods and genuinely non-trivial.

---

## ADR-004: Dependency versions
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Spring Boot 4.0.6 is the latest stable patch; Vaadin 25.1.5 aligns with the
Spring Boot 4.x BOM; AWS SDK bumped from 2.25.60 for security patches and API improvements.

**Decision:** Spring Boot 4.0.6, Vaadin 25.1.5, AWS S3 SDK 2.44.4.

**Consequences:** Rejected: Jackson 3 migration (`tools.jackson:jackson-databind:3.1.2`) —
Maven artifacts for the `tools.jackson` groupId are unverified. Revisit when official release
is confirmed.

---

## ADR-005: Modular storage — contract in attachment-starter, not marketplace
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Storage only exists to serve attachments — no use case for storage without attachments.

**Decision:** `StorageService` interface and implementations live in `attachment-spring-boot-starter`
(`org.ost.attachment.storage`). UI components use `ObjectProvider.ifAvailable()` to degrade
gracefully when the attachment starter is absent.

**Consequences:** Rejected: keeping `storage-s3-spring-boot-starter` as a separate module —
two modules with a mandatory one-way dependency and no realistic decoupling scenario.

---

## ADR-006: Audit subsystem in audit-spring-boot-starter; domain calls via AuditPort
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Audit is infrastructure, not domain. Domain services calling audit internals directly
would couple business logic to audit infrastructure.

**Decision:** The full audit subsystem (write + read sides) lives in `audit-spring-boot-starter`.
All Vaadin audit UI lives in `marketplace-app`. Domain services call `AuditPort` (contract interface).
The starter contains zero advertisement-specific knowledge — all domain coupling expressed through
SPIs (`AuditDomainHook`, `AuditActivityFieldsHook`, `AuditActivityEnrichHook`) implemented in
`marketplace-app`.

**Consequences:** Rejected: conditional Spring annotations in `platform-commons` — contracts must
be Spring-free pure Java.

---

## ADR-007: @EnableMethodSecurity active; @PreAuthorize not at class level on services
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Vaadin view beans are initialized on the first HTTP request — before the user
authenticates. Class-level `@PreAuthorize` on services breaks this initialization with
`AuthorizationDeniedException`.

**Decision:** `@EnableMethodSecurity` added to `SecurityConfig`. `@PreAuthorize("isAuthenticated()")`
NOT applied at class level on services. `/health` endpoint is intentionally public.
Future non-public REST endpoints use `@PreAuthorize` at method level on the controller.

**Consequences:** Rejected: class-level `@PreAuthorize` on `AdvertisementService`,
`AuditReadService`, `UserSettingsService` — confirmed broken via smoke tests.

---

## ADR-008: Double-click guard on save buttons via setEnabled
**Status:** Accepted, mechanism superseded by ADR-020 (2026-07-01, corrected 2026-07-16)

**Context:** Rapid double-click submits the form twice, causing duplicate saves.

**Decision:** Save buttons are disabled on click to prevent a double submit.

**Consequences (updated 2026-07-16 — verified against current code, original text was stale):**
The guard no longer lives in each handler's `activate()` with a `finally` block re-enable, as
originally described here. It now lives in shared
`AbstractFormOverlayModeHandler.wireSaveGuard()` (`saveBtn.setEnabled(false)` on click, no
`finally` block anywhere in this flow) — re-enabling happens instead via `afterSave(boolean)` →
`updateButtons()` in each concrete handler (e.g. `AdvertisementFormOverlayModeHandler
.afterSave()`), called unconditionally from every branch of `AbstractEntityOverlay.handleSave()`.
This is ADR-020's later, more general lifecycle mechanism — this entry should have been marked
Superseded when ADR-020 landed and wasn't; corrected here instead of duplicating ADR-020's fuller
description.

---

## ADR-009: ValidRange.List without @Constraint; ValidRangeValidator caches field lookups
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Jakarta Bean Validation 3.0 spec says container annotations should carry
`@Constraint(validatedBy = {})`, but Hibernate Validator (Spring Boot 4.0.6) does NOT support
this for class-level (`ElementType.TYPE`) constraints — adding it causes `HV000030: No validator
could be found` at runtime.

**Decision:** The inner `@List` annotation on `@ValidRange` intentionally omits
`@Constraint(validatedBy = {})`. `ValidRangeValidator` caches reflected fields in a static
`ConcurrentHashMap` keyed by `FieldKey(class, start, end)`.

**Consequences:** Rejected: adding `@Constraint(validatedBy = {})` to `ValidRange.List` —
confirmed broken at runtime via smoke tests.

---

## ADR-010: Restore semantics — restore TO snapshot, not BEFORE snapshot
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** The previous behavior restored to the state *before* a change, not *to* that
snapshot — inverting the UX expectation.

**Decision:** Clicking a restore button restores the entity to the state captured in the clicked
entry's snapshot (`getSnapshotContent`). `getPreviousSnapshotContent` was reserved for diff
display only, and has since been removed entirely (see `audit-spring-boot-starter/DECISIONS.md`
ADR-008's amendment) — diff display now works directly from snapshot pairs.

**Consequences (corrected 2026-07-13 — method names had drifted):** all restore flows call
`AuditPort.getSnapshotContent(snapshotId, entityType)`. Current entry points:
`AdvertisementFormOverlayModeHandler.handleRestoreFromActivity`,
`UserFormOverlayModeHandler`'s equivalent, `SettingsFormModeHandler.handleRestoreFromActivity`,
and `TaxonFormOverlayModeHandler`'s own restore flow (added when taxon-spring-boot-starter
landed, not present when this ADR was originally written). The originally-cited method names
(`UserOverlay.handleRestoreUser`, `AdvertisementService.restoreToSnapshot`) do not exist — only
`UserService.restoreToSnapshot` (user-spring-boot-starter) matches that exact name today.

---

## ADR-011: OverlayFormBinder used directly — no AuditUiPort
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** `AuditUiPort` was removed 2026-06-15 as unnecessary indirection — all Vaadin UI
lives in marketplace-app, so there is no second consumer that would require the SPI.

**Decision:** `OverlayFormBinder` (corrected 2026-07-13 — named `AuditSnapshotBinder` originally,
which no longer exists anywhere in the codebase; `OverlayFormBinder` is the class performing this
role today) used directly in marketplace-app UI components.

**Consequences:** Do not re-introduce `AuditUiPort`.

---

## ADR-012: No shared UI module — plain-class pattern for future sharing
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** No actual cross-module UI duplication exists as of 2026-05-26. `PaginationBar` and
`EmptyStateView` exist only in `marketplace-app`. Multiplying modules has real cost.

**Decision:** No new UI module (`advertisement-ui-core` or similar). If cross-module sharing ever
becomes real, move the component to `platform-commons` as a plain class (no `@SpringComponent`,
no `@Scope`). Each consuming module declares its own `@Bean @Scope("prototype")` in a local
`@Configuration`.

**Consequences:** Rejected: separate `advertisement-ui-core` module.
Rejected: making `platform-commons` a starter — commons has no Vaadin dependency.
Prerequisite for any component moved to commons: remove all marketplace-specific imports
(`I18nKey`, `I18nParams`, `PaginationDefaults`) — pass as constructor parameters instead.

---

## ADR-013: AbstractViewOverlayModeHandler — template method for tabbed view overlays
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** `AdvertisementViewOverlayModeHandler` and `UserViewOverlayModeHandler` had identical
tab-switching and lazy-loading boilerplate (~15 lines each).

**Decision:** All "view mode" overlay handlers extend `AbstractViewOverlayModeHandler`. The base
class provides `final activate(OverlayLayout)` that assembles the tab layout. Only two methods
are truly `abstract` (corrected 2026-07-13 — not "five abstract methods" as originally written):
`buildPrimaryContent()` and `buildHeaderActions()`. `tabsCssClass()` (default `""`),
`buildSecondaryTab()`, and `buildTertiaryTab()` (both default `null`) have default bodies and are
overridden only when needed.

`SecondaryTabDef` record `(Tab tab, String cssClass, Supplier<Component> loader)` represents the
optional second tab. Returning `null` from `buildSecondaryTab()` produces a single-tab layout.

**Addition (2026-07-13, previously undocumented):** a `TertiaryTabDef` record of the same shape
plus a `buildTertiaryTab()` hook were added since this ADR was written, supporting a third tab —
used by `TaxonFormOverlayModeHandler`/`ReferenceDataView`'s sub-tabs (taxon-spring-boot-starter
landed after this ADR). Same override-for-null-default pattern as `SecondaryTabDef`.

**Consequences:** Rejected: `TabbedOverlayContent` as a Spring `@Prototype` `Configurable` bean
— passing live UI components as `Parameters` violates the convention that Parameters carry
data/config, not pre-built component trees.

---

## ADR-014: Audit writes belong in the service layer, not the UI
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** `SettingsOverlay.handleSave()` was calling `auditPortFactory.captureUpdate(...)`
directly — the only place in the entire UI layer that fired an audit write. All other entities
correctly placed audit calls inside the service.

**Decision:** `AuditPort.captureUpdate` / `captureCreation` / `captureDeletion` must only be
called from `*Service` classes — never from UI overlays, view components, or `*HookImpl` classes.
`UserSettingsService.save()` now loads old settings, saves, publishes the domain event, and
captures the audit entry.

**Consequences:** When a save/update/delete operation needs to be audited, put the `AuditPort`
call at the end of the corresponding `*Service.save()` / `*Service.delete()` method. The UI
layer calls the service; the service handles persistence + audit atomically.

---

## ADR-015: *HookImpl — no snapshot inspection, pure delegation
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** `AuditDomainHookImpl.resolveDisplayName()` was directly accessing `ad.title()` and
`u.name()` from snapshot DTOs and applying a null guard — business logic embedded in a hook.

**Decision:** `*HookImpl` methods must not access fields of snapshot DTOs or apply any
formatting/resolution logic. Each switch branch must contain exactly one service call.
Entity-type routing (a `switch` over `EntityType`) is the only permitted logic in a `*HookImpl`.

**Consequences:** If a `*HookImpl` method needs entity-specific data, add a method to the
corresponding `*Service` and delegate.

---

## ADR-016: Full user decoupling — marketplace no longer imports org.ost.user.* internals
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** marketplace-app previously imported `User` entity, `UserService`, `UserSettingsService`,
and `UserPrincipal` directly — violating the module import rule.

**Decision:**
- `AuthenticatedPrincipal` SPI added to `platform-commons` (`org.ost.platform.user.spi`).
- `UserPrincipal` (user-starter) implements `AuthenticatedPrincipal.toUserDto()`.
- `AuthContextService` rewritten: reads `AuthenticatedPrincipal` via pattern matching; returns `Optional<UserDto>`.
- `UserPort` gains `save(UserProfileDto, Long actingUserId)` and `refreshCurrentUserInContext(Long userId)`.
- All 22 files now use `UserDto`/`UserPort` from platform-commons exclusively.

Key design — `refreshCurrentUserInContext` in `UserPort`: updating the Spring Security principal
requires `UserPrincipal(User)` — which needs the password hash (not in `UserDto`). Moving this
responsibility into `UserPortImpl` avoids exposing the `User` entity or password hash across the
module boundary.

**Consequences:** `UserSortMeta` and `UserQueryConfig`: `User.Fields.*` replaced with string
literals (field names are stable). `UserMapper` maps `UserDto → UserEditDto`.

---

## ADR-017: Decoupling debt at the time of writing — all items since resolved
**Status:** Resolved (was undated/open at write time; every item below closed by 2026-06-26 —
verified 2026-07-13: `org.ost.attachment.*`/`org.ost.user.*` internal imports in marketplace-app
both return zero grep hits. This ADR previously had no `Status:` line at all despite every listed
item already being marked resolved inline — the one structural inconsistency found across this
file's 33 ADRs.)

**Architecture rule (2026-06-15):** marketplace-app UI is a monolith — decoupling is required
only at the service ↔ UI boundary (starters vs marketplace-app). Within marketplace-app, UI
components may reference each other freely. UI ports/hooks (`AuditUiPort`, `AttachmentGalleryPort`,
`AuditActivityRowHook`) were removed as unnecessary indirection.

### ✅ Resolved — attachment UI boundary violations (2026-06-26)

`MediaContentTypeUtil` merged into `AttachmentMediaContentType` enum (platform-commons). All attachment UI components now import only from `platform-commons`. No `org.ost.attachment.*` imports remain in marketplace-app.

→ [improvement-001-attachment-ui-boundary-violation](../backlog/completed/issues/improvement-001-attachment-ui-boundary-violation.md) (completed)

→ [improvement-004-accessevaluator-boundary-violation](../backlog/completed/issues/improvement-004-accessevaluator-boundary-violation.md) (completed)

### ✅ Resolved — marketplace-app → org.ost.user.* internals (2026-06-15)

All 22 files now use `UserDto`/`UserPort` from platform-commons exclusively. See ADR-016.

### ✅ Resolved — org.ost.marketplace.security.* uses User entity (2026-06-15)

`OwnershipChecker`, `RoleChecker`, `AccessEvaluator` updated. `AuthContextService.getCurrentUser()`
returns `Optional<UserDto>`. `AuthenticatedPrincipal` SPI is the boundary.

---

## ADR-018: Top-level Timeline tab
**Status:** Accepted (done 2026-06-23)

**Context:** Per-overlay timeline queried by `actor_id` only. A top-level tab with proper filters
gives full audit context without navigating into individual overlays.

**Decision:** Added a dedicated **Timeline** navigation tab (alongside Listings and Users) with
filter, sort, and pagination. Inline timeline tabs removed from `UserOverlay` and `SettingsOverlay`.

Components: `TimelineView` (`@UIScope`), `TimelineQueryBlock`, `AuditTimelineListRenderer`,
`AuditTimelineRowRenderer`, `PaginationBar`. Visibility gated by `access.canView()`.
USER role: only own activity (actor filter forced server-side by `AccessEvaluator`).

**Consequences:** Key lesson: `TimelineView` must override `setVisible(boolean)` to call
`refreshFeed()` — tab switching uses `setVisible()`, not component detach/attach, so
`@PostConstruct` alone produces stale data after mutations.

---

---

## ADR-019: Taxon/Category domain extracted as standalone starter
**Status:** Accepted (done 2026-06-26)

**Context:** Advertisement categories (and future tags) are a classification taxonomy that:
- spans multiple entity types (`ADVERTISEMENT`, potentially `USER`, etc.)
- requires soft-delete + restore (same as advertisement/user)
- needs multilingual translations (locale-keyed)
- must be audited (category assignments recorded in audit_log)

Embedding this inside `advertisement-spring-boot-starter` would couple two distinct domains and
prevent reuse across other entity types.

**Decision:** New `taxon-spring-boot-starter` module owns:
- `taxon`, `taxon_translation`, `taxon_assignment` tables (Liquibase changelog at `db/taxon-changelog/`)
- `Taxon`, `TaxonTranslation`, `TaxonAssignment` entities
- `TaxonService`, `TaxonAssignmentService` — business logic
- `DefaultTaxonPort` — coordination layer (not pure delegation: it resolves translations and builds DTOs)
- `TaxonProperties` — configurable `defaultLocale` for translation fallback

SPI contracts in `platform-commons`:
- `TaxonPort` (marketplace → starter) — CRUD, assignment management, batched queries
- `TaxonAuditHook` (starter → marketplace) — fires when assignments change

Marketplace-app additions:
- `TaxonManagementView` + `TaxonOverlay` + `TaxonFormOverlayModeHandler` + `TaxonViewOverlayModeHandler`
- `ReferenceDataView` — tab container for taxon management (nested sub-tabs)
- **Not implemented (corrected 2026-07-16 — verified against current code, original text was
  aspirational):** `TaxonAuditHookImpl` and `TaxonActivityService` were planned here but were
  never written — `services/audit/taxon/` exists as an empty package, `TaxonAuditHook`
  (`platform-commons`) has zero implementing classes anywhere in the repo. `TaxonAssignmentService
  .assign()/unassign()` still fires `onAssignmentChanged` via `auditHook.ifAvailable(...)`, which
  is a graceful no-op today since nothing is registered to receive it. **Concrete consequence:**
  category assignment changes on advertisements are not recorded to the audit log at all —
  contrary to this ADR's own stated goal ("must be audited") and to
  `taxon-spring-boot-starter/CLAUDE.md`'s claim that `TaxonAuditHookImpl` records this. Tracked as
  [improvement-058](../backlog/issues/improvement-058-taxon-assignment-audit-trail-missing.md).

`TaxonType` enum (in `platform-commons`) — closed set: currently `CATEGORY`. Adding a new type
is a release-level change requiring UI, audit translations, and seed entries.

Advertisement filtering by category: `AdvertisementRepository` calls
`TaxonPort.findEntityIdsWithAnyTaxon()` to translate taxon ids into entity ids — no direct
join to `taxon_assignment` table from advertisement code.

**Consequences:**
- `EntityType.TAXON` added to `platform-commons` for audit records of taxon entity changes.
- `ReferenceDataView` added as a new top-level navigation tab with sub-tabs per taxon type.
- Taxon CRUD triggers `TaxonAuditHook.onAssignmentChanged()` from `TaxonAssignmentService`.
- `DefaultTaxonPort` is permitted to contain coordination logic (translation fallback chain,
  DTO assembly) because the alternative would require exposing TaxonTranslation internals
  to marketplace-app — that would be a worse boundary violation.

## ADR-020: AbstractEntityOverlay<H> — currentFormHandler and save/cancel lifecycle in base class
**Status:** Accepted (done 2026-07-01)

**Context:** Concrete overlay classes (`AdvertisementOverlay`, `UserOverlay`, `TaxonOverlay`,
`SettingsOverlay`) each duplicated the same `currentFormHandler` field, `handleSave()` try/catch
block, `doCancel()` dispatch, and `hasUnsavedChanges()` check. Any fix in one overlay had to be
applied to all others.

**Decision:** `AbstractEntityOverlay<H extends AbstractFormOverlayModeHandler<?>>` now owns:
- `protected H currentFormHandler` — typed field for the active form handler
- `protected final handleSave()` — shared save lifecycle (try/catch, `afterSave(bool)`, `proceed()`)
- `protected final doCancel()` — calls `currentFormHandler.discardChanges()`, then `afterDiscard()`
- `protected final hasUnsavedChanges()` — null-safe check via `currentFormHandler.hasChanges()`

Concrete overlays implement abstract hooks: `saveConfig()`, `proceed()`, `afterDiscard()`.

**Consequences:**
- `switchTo()` must reset `currentFormHandler = null` before the switch expression — without this,
  after `VIEW → EDIT → VIEW` the handler remains non-null and `hasUnsavedChanges()` returns `true`.
- `SaveConfig` record `(I18nKey success, I18nKey validFailed, I18nKey saveError, I18nKey conflict)`
  declares error key mapping per overlay type — `conflict` added by ADR-029 (optimistic-locking
  UI) after this ADR was written; noted here 2026-07-13 since this ADR's body was never amended.

---

## ADR-021: QuillEditor — custom Vaadin web component for rich-text editing
**Status:** Accepted (done 2026-07-01)

**Context:** Advertisement descriptions require rich-text formatting (bold, italic, links, paragraph
blocks). Vaadin's built-in `TextArea` is plain-text only; embedding Quill as a web component
gives native Vaadin field integration with value binding.

**Decision:** `QuillEditor` extends `AbstractSinglePropertyField<QuillEditor, String>`, registered
via `@Tag("quill-editor")`, `@NpmPackage(value="quill", version="2.0.3")`, and `@JsModule("./quill-editor.js")`.
Implements `HasSize` and `HasLabel` for standard Vaadin field behavior. The custom element handles
Quill initialization and bidirectional value sync.

**Consequences:**
- `quill-editor.js` lives in `marketplace-app/src/main/frontend/` (Vaadin Vite entry).
- HTML output is sanitized server-side in `AdvertisementService` using OWASP HTML Sanitizer
  (`Sanitizers.FORMATTING.and(LINKS).and(BLOCKS)`) — server never trusts raw HTML from the client.
- Used in `AdvertisementFormOverlayModeHandler` and `TaxonFormOverlayModeHandler` for description fields.

**Update (2026-07-04) — false-dirty-state bug and its proper fix:** editing an advertisement
whose description contained rich HTML made Save/Discard appear active immediately on opening
the form, with no actual edit. Root cause: `quill-editor.js` loaded/restored content via direct
`this.__quill.root.innerHTML = ...` assignment, bypassing Quill's API entirely. Quill's own
MutationObserver-based change detection treats any DOM mutation it didn't originate through its
own API as an external, `'user'`-sourced change — so loading a value re-triggered Quill's HTML
serializer (`getSemanticHTML()`), which normalizes rich HTML (quotes/attributes/tag structure)
differently byte-for-byte from what was stored, and dispatched a spurious `value-changed` event
that Vaadin's `Binder` picked up as a real edit (`Binder` has no `fromClient`-aware guard against
this — confirmed against decompiled `flow-data` bytecode).

An earlier, undocumented attempt to fix this (`awaitingNormalization` flag + `setPresentationValue`/
`setModelValue` overrides in `QuillEditor.java`, added 2026-07-03 in commit `94647d9e` under an
unrelated "docs sync" commit message) did not work, because it assumed `Binder` inspects
`fromClient` on the changed binding — it doesn't.

**Proper fix:** use Quill's own native `source` parameter instead of custom bookkeeping. All
programmatic content loads (`connectedCallback()` initial load, `set value()`) now go through
`quill.setContents(delta, 'silent')` — Quill's `'silent'` source never fires `text-change` at
all, so there is no echo to filter. The `text-change` listener needs no source check: since our
own writes never reach it, anything that does fire there is a genuine change (real typing,
toolbar clicks, or an external API call like `quill.setContents(delta)` without an explicit
source — which Quill tags `'api'`, not `'user'`; an earlier draft of this fix filtered on
`source === 'user'` and broke Playwright's rich-text test helper, which calls `setContents`
directly without a source argument). The dead `awaitingNormalization` mechanism in
`QuillEditor.java` was removed as part of this fix — see the corresponding commit for both files.
Confirmed this is also how Vaadin's own (commercial, CVALv3-licensed) `RichTextEditor` add-on
solves the identical problem internally (its Quill-wrapping mixin uses the same `source`
tagging), validating the approach against a production-proven precedent without needing the
paid component itself.

## ADR-022: isCurrentState — criteria for "Current state" badge vs Restore button
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** The audit activity panel shows a "Current state" badge on historical versions that
match the current entity state, and a "Restore" button on versions that differ. The criteria for
equality must cover all user-visible fields so that the badge only appears when restoring would
have no effect.

**Decision:** A historical snapshot is considered "current state" when its full
`AdvertisementSnapshotDto` record equals the current one via `Objects.equals` — covering `title`,
`description`, `categoryIds`, and (since improvement's advertisement-snapshot-redesign,
corrected here 2026-07-16) `attachmentSnapshotId`, a soft reference to the attachment gallery's
current snapshot id. Media is no longer compared via a separate hook call — it's folded into the
same single record-equality check as every other field, because `attachmentSnapshotId` lives
directly on `AdvertisementSnapshotDto`. `AuditActivityRowRenderer` computes the badge with exactly
one line: `Objects.equals(h.snapshotData(), cfg.currentSnapshot())`.

If any of these differ, the "Restore" button is shown. If all are identical, the badge is shown.

`AdvertisementSnapshotDto` stores `categoryIds` as a `List<Long>` of numeric category ids, sorted
at construction time (corrected 2026-07-13 — originally written as "a sorted, comma-joined string
of category names"; verified directly in `AdvertisementSnapshotDto.java`: the field is
`List<Long> categoryIds`, compared and diffed via `Objects.equals`/`FieldChange`, never a
name-based string — the diff display formats ids to a comma-separated string only for the UI
diff view, the stored/compared value itself is numeric ids). `Objects.equals` on the full record
covers title + description + categoryIds + attachmentSnapshotId in one comparison (see the
corrected Decision above — `AuditActivityEnrichHook` has no `matchesCurrent`/`mediaMatchCurrent`
method; that mechanism was removed by advertisement-snapshot-redesign, not just renamed).

Update (2026-07-03, snapshot-cleanup): `CategoryChangeSnapshotDto` and the
`AuditableSnapshot.isVisible()` mechanism were removed entirely — after
advertisement-snapshot-redesign no snapshot type ever returned `false`, making the visibility
filter in `AuditActivityPanel` a no-op. Category change information rides in the main
`AdvertisementSnapshotDto` diff; no row-hiding machinery exists anymore
(see `backlog/completed/issues/feature-006-snapshot-cleanup.md`).

---

## ADR-023: TransactionTemplate orchestrator — preferred pattern for multi-step backend operations
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Some save flows require calling multiple ports in a specific order within one
transaction. The canonical example: `advertisementPort.save()` → `captureSnapshot` →
`taxonPort.replaceAssignments()`. With `@Transactional` on service methods, the order is
controlled by implementation details buried inside each starter's service — invisible to the
caller. Self-invocation tricks (inner `@Component`, self-injection) work but obscure intent.

**Decision:** Use `TransactionTemplate` in a dedicated `*SaveService` (or `*Orchestrator`) class
in `marketplace-app` whenever a save flow requires:
- calling two or more ports in a controlled order, AND/OR
- mixing non-transactional work (S3, external calls) with transactional DB writes

Pattern:
```java
@Service
@RequiredArgsConstructor
class FooSaveService {
    private final TransactionTemplate tx;

    public Long save(FooSaveDto dto, Long actorId,
                     Runnable preCommitExternal,  // S3, external — outside TX
                     Runnable captureSnapshot) {  // DB only — inside TX
        preCommitExternal.run();                  // outside transaction

        return tx.execute(status -> {
            Long savedId = fooPort.get().save(dto, actorId);
            captureSnapshot.run();                // before side-effects that shift audit window
            barPort.ifAvailable(p -> p.doSideEffect(savedId, dto));
            return savedId;
        });
    }
}
```

`TransactionTemplate` is auto-configured by Spring Boot from `PlatformTransactionManager` —
inject directly, no `@Bean` declaration needed. Inner port `@Transactional` methods join the
existing TX via default `REQUIRED` propagation.

**Consequences:**
- Transaction boundary is explicit and visible in code — not hidden behind `@Transactional` on a
  deeply nested service method.
- Non-transactional work (S3) is clearly separated from DB work by position in the method.
- Order of operations is enforced structurally, not by convention.
- Rejected: inner `@Component` static class — workaround that obscures why the extra class exists.
- Rejected: self-injection (`@Lazy @Autowired FooService self`) — same workaround category.
- Rejected: two separate `@Transactional` service classes — atomicity not guaranteed across calls.

---

## ADR-024: Jsoup-based, defense-in-depth description length validation
**Status:** Accepted (done 2026-07-04)

**Context:** `AdvertisementSaveDto.DESCRIPTION_MAX_LENGTH = 2000` existed as a constant but was
enforced only by a client-reachable, regex-based binder validator
(`html.replaceAll("<[^>]+>", "")` + length check) that tag-spam could bypass — formatting tags
like `<b></b>` survive the OWASP sanitizer (it preserves allowed tags), so thousands of empty
ones pass the stripped-text check while still bloating the stored HTML
(`backlog/completed/issues/issue-description-length-tag-spam.md`). No server-side length
guard existed at all — a direct port call bypassing the UI could persist an unbounded
description.

**Decision:** three-layer validation, none of them removable without reopening a gap:
1. **Raw-size cap** — `@Size(max = DESCRIPTION_RAW_MAX_LENGTH = 20_000)` on
   `AdvertisementSaveDto.description` (`platform-commons`) — plain Bean Validation, no new
   dependency, bounds worst-case payload size before any parsing.
2. **UI content check** — `AdvertisementFormOverlayModeHandler`'s binder validator replaced
   the regex with `Jsoup.parse(html).text().length() <= DESCRIPTION_MAX_LENGTH`.
3. **Service-level guard** — `AdvertisementService.sanitizeHtml()` calls a new
   `validateDescriptionLength()` using the same Jsoup check on the *sanitized* HTML, throwing
   `IllegalArgumentException` on overflow. No new exception-handling plumbing was needed:
   `AbstractEntityOverlay.handleSave()` already has a generic `catch (Exception e)` that shows
   `e.getMessage()` via `NotificationService`.

`org.jsoup:jsoup:${jsoup.version}` (`1.22.1`, new root-pom property, same pattern as
`aws-s3-sdk.version`) was added directly to `marketplace-app` and
`advertisement-spring-boot-starter` — **not** to `platform-commons`, keeping the shared kernel
dependency-free per its governance rules. The one-line Jsoup check is intentionally duplicated
in both layers (UI for fast feedback, service for real enforcement) rather than factored into
a shared utility — a single line of logic does not justify a cross-module abstraction, and the
two layers have no natural common module to live in without violating the starter/UI
boundary.

**Consequences:**
- `improvement-006` (Quill UI character counter + `advertisement.description` DB column limit)
  was unblocked by this ADR and has since been **completed** (closed 2026-07-13 via ADR-031 —
  updated here since this ADR still said "remains open" after that closure).
- Any future field with the same "rich HTML but bounded visible text" shape should follow the
  same three-layer pattern rather than reaching for `@Size` directly on the HTML string.

## ADR-025: Deny-by-default at the Spring Security URL layer is incompatible with this app's Vaadin routing model

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** `improvement-020` proposed hardening `SecurityConfig` from `anyRequest().permitAll()`
to `anyRequest().denyAll()` (permitting only `vaadinInternalRequestMatcher` and `/health`), to
guard against future public REST endpoints being accidentally exposed. Deployed and tested via
the full Playwright e2e suite: **0/46 tests passed** — the root page itself never rendered.

Root cause, confirmed via `HandlerHelper.isFrameworkInternalRequest`'s actual implementation:
it matches only Vaadin's internal AJAX/RPC traffic (UIDL, heartbeat, push, upload, dynamic
resource requests) — **not** the root page bootstrap (`GET /`) that serves the application shell.
Since `MainView` is the sole `@Route("")` and the entire app is one Vaadin SPA behind that single
route, `anyRequest().denyAll()` blocks the application shell itself, not just hypothetical future
REST endpoints.

This is consistent with ADR-007: access control for Vaadin views in this app is enforced *inside*
the view (`AccessEvaluator`, hidden tabs), not via Spring Security URL matching — a direct
consequence of Vaadin initializing view beans before authentication completes.

**Decision:** Reverted to `anyRequest().permitAll()`. Deny-by-default at the URL layer does not
apply to a monolithic Vaadin SPA; instead, each future non-Vaadin REST controller (webhooks,
sitemap, etc.) must declare its own explicit `requestMatchers(...)` rule ahead of the Vaadin
catch-all, as a discipline/process rule rather than a global switch.

**Consequences:**
- `SecurityConfig` keeps `anyRequest().permitAll()`; only `/health` and the Vaadin internal
  matcher get explicit rules.
- Any new REST controller added later must add its own security rule *before* the catch-all —
  reviewers should treat a missing explicit rule on a new controller as a blocker.

## ADR-026: Rate limiting counts only real failures, never successful attempts

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** `improvement-020` also added Caffeine-based rate limiting to `AuthService.login()`
(`org.ost.marketplace.services.auth` — corrected 2026-07-13; `AuthService` lives in
marketplace-app, not `org.ost.user.services`) and `UserService.register()` (`org.ost.user.services`,
correct as originally written). The first version incremented the attempt counter on *every* call
regardless of outcome. This broke the Playwright e2e suite:
all signups run from the same client IP (the test-runner container), and the 6th successful
signup within the 15-minute window was rejected as "too many attempts" — the generic
`catch (Exception ex)` in `SignUpDialog` then misreported it as "email already registered",
masking the real cause.

**Decision:** Both limiters now increment only on an actual failure:
- `AuthService.login()` — increments on `BadCredentialsException`, invalidates the cache entry
  on success (unchanged from the original design — this one was correct from the start).
- `UserService.register()` — increments only on `DuplicateKeyException` from `repository.save()`
  (a TOCTOU race past the client-side email-uniqueness check); the client-side binder validator
  already rejects duplicate emails before `register()` is ever called, so this path is rare by
  design. Successful registrations never count toward the limit.

Both dialogs (`LoginDialog`, `SignUpDialog`) catch `IllegalStateException` (thrown when the
limit is exceeded) separately from the generic exception handler, showing a dedicated
"too many attempts, try again later" notification (`LOGIN_ERROR_TOO_MANY_ATTEMPTS`,
`SIGNUP_ERROR_TOO_MANY_ATTEMPTS`) instead of a misleading generic error.

**Consequences:**
- e2e coverage: `02-marketplace-authentication-flow.spec.js` — `rateLimitUser exceeds login
  attempts` test signs up a dedicated throwaway user and drives 5 wrong-password attempts + a
  6th blocked attempt, to avoid locking out shared `TEST_USERS` accounts used by later specs.
- No equivalent e2e test exists for the registration limiter's `DuplicateKeyException` path —
  it is not reachable through the normal UI flow (client-side check intercepts first) and would
  require bypassing that check to force a real race.

## ADR-027: forward-headers-strategy so registration rate limiting sees the real client IP

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** An external audit pass (round 7) found that `UserService.register()`'s rate
limiter (ADR-026) keys solely on `clientIp` (`request.getRemoteAddr()` from
`SignUpDialog`), with no email component (unlike the login limiter, which keys on
`remoteAddr + "|" + email` and stays scoped to one target account even if `remoteAddr`
collapses). The project's README documents the deployed target as Render, which — like
essentially all PaaS providers — terminates the connection at its own edge and forwards to the
app instance over its internal network. `server.forward-headers-strategy` was not configured
anywhere, so `request.getRemoteAddr()` returned Render's internal proxy address for every
user, not the real client IP. This collapsed the registration limiter into one shared bucket
for the entire platform: 5 failed registrations from anyone (even organic
`DuplicateKeyException` races) would lock out registration for everyone for 15 minutes.

**Decision:** `application-prod.yml` — added `server.forward-headers-strategy: framework`, so
Spring's `ForwardedHeaderFilter` translates `X-Forwarded-For` into the request's apparent
remote address before the app sees it. This assumes Render forwards this header (standard
PaaS behavior) — not independently verifiable from this dev environment; needs confirming
once actually deployed.

A coarser global (IP-independent) backstop limiter was considered and rejected: registration
failures don't have a natural key to count against the way login does (a login failure is
always a guess against one specific existing account; a registration failure is a random
collision with whatever email happened to already be taken, essentially never the same email
retried), so a second counter added complexity without a clean justification for this
codebase's actual threat model. Fixing the IP resolution itself is the real fix.

**Consequences:**
- The login limiter (`AuthService`) was not touched — its compound key already scopes lockout
  to one target account even under a fully collapsed `remoteAddr`.

## ADR-028: SettingsPaginationService — per-user ownership on bindings, detach-based cleanup

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** `SettingsPaginationService` is a singleton `@Component` holding a
`CopyOnWriteArrayList<BindingEntry>` shared across every user's UI session. Two problems found
via external audit + internal verification:
1. **Cross-session bleed (bug):** `onSettingsChanged(userId, settings)` only checked whether
   the *current thread's* user matched `userId`, then pushed the new page size to **every**
   registered `PaginationBar` across **all** sessions — so when user X changed their page size,
   users Y and Z had their live grids silently resized to X's value until they next reloaded
   the view. Invisible in single-user e2e (only one logged-in user drives each test).
2. **UI-reference leak risk:** the singleton held strong references to `PaginationBar` (→ the
   whole UI subtree) with cleanup relying entirely on views calling `unregister()` from
   `@PreDestroy`; any path that skips that callback pins a dead UI tree in the service forever.

**Decision:** `BindingEntry` now carries the owning `userId` (captured from
`AuthContextService` at `register()` time). `onSettingsChanged` filters `entries` by
`entry.userId().equals(userId)` instead of gating on the current thread's user — this fixes the
bleed regardless of which thread fires the hook, and drops the now-redundant
`authContextService.getCurrentUser()` pre-filter entirely. `register()` also adds
`bar.addDetachListener(_ -> unregister(bar))`, so cleanup no longer depends solely on
`@PreDestroy` being called correctly on every path; `unregister()` remains for the explicit
call.

**Consequences:**
- `SettingsPaginationBinding` and the three call sites (`AdvertisementsView`, `TimelineView`,
  `UserView`) are unchanged — same `register`/`unregister` signatures.
- e2e coverage: extended `05-seed-filter-sort-pagination.spec.js` — `adminEn changes page
  sizes...` test now opens a second browser context logged in as `userEn` right after `adminEn`
  changes their own page size, and asserts `userEn`'s Advertisements grid still shows the
  default page size (unaffected).

## ADR-029: Optimistic locking via a stored version column — no auto-reload on conflict

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** No entity carried a version field; two concurrent edits of the same advertisement,
user, or taxon resulted in silent last-write-wins — the second save overwrote the first with no
error, audit anomaly, or warning to either editor (improvement-015). With the planned community
migration (24k members, moderators/owners editing shared listings) this stops being a rare
accident. Several alternatives were discussed and rejected before settling on this design:
- Computing a "version" on the fly from `audit_log` (the way the audit timeline already does via
  a `ROW_NUMBER()`/`COUNT(*)` window function, see audit-spring-boot-starter ADR-020) — rejected:
  audit is optional (`ComponentFactory<AuditPort>.ifAvailable()`), so core save correctness can't
  depend on it, and not every bespoke UPDATE writes an audit row.
- Comparing `updated_at` instead of adding a column — rejected: equality on a high-precision
  timestamp across a DB → Java `Instant` → JSON/DTO round trip is fragile (rounding, truncation);
  an integer counter never has that class of bug, which is why every mainstream ORM (Rails
  `lock_version`, Hibernate/JPA `@Version`, EF Core `rowversion`) uses one.
- A full-row compare (`WHERE title = :old AND description = :old ...`) — avoids a new column and
  isn't precision-fragile, but flags a conflict on *any* field touched by someone else, even one
  the current editor never looked at. Rejected in favor of the simpler, standard column.

**Decision:** `version BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0` added directly to the existing
`01-advertisement-schema.xml`, `01-user-schema.xml`, and `001-taxon.xml` changesets (DB not yet
in production — no new migration file, per the same rationale as the `taxon.deleted_by` column;
requires `deploy.sh --reset` locally). `@Version private Long version;` added to `Advertisement`,
`User`, `Taxon`.

For `Advertisement` and `Taxon`, saves go through `CrudRepository.save()`, so Spring Data JDBC's
`@Version` handling applies natively — it appends `WHERE version = ?` and throws
`OptimisticLockingFailureException` on a mismatch. Two places rebuild the entity via `Builder`
before saving and were missed on the first pass because they don't automatically carry the field
forward: `AdvertisementService.buildEntity()` and `TaxonService.update()` — both now explicitly
forward the version from the incoming DTO / port parameter (the value the caller last read),
**not** a version re-fetched inside the same save method (which would just match itself and
detect nothing).

`User`'s real edit path (`UserService.save()` → `UserRepository.updateProfile()`) originally
bypassed `CrudRepository` entirely via hand-written SQL, so `@Version` alone did nothing there.
`updateProfile()` did the check by hand: `SET ..., version = version + 1 WHERE id = :id AND
version = :version`, throwing `OptimisticLockingFailureException` manually when zero rows match.

**Update (2026-07-14) — `User` moved onto native `CrudRepository.save()` too:** a second, narrower
entity, `UserProfileUpdate` (`id`, `name`, `role`, `updatedAt`, `version` — deliberately excludes
`email`/`passwordHash`), mapped to the same `user_information` table via its own
`UserProfileCrudRepository`, replaces the hand-written SQL in `UserRepository.updateProfile()`.
This was chosen over mirroring `AdvertisementService.buildEntity()`/`TaxonService.update()`
(rebuild the full entity via `Builder`, forwarding every unedited field from `before`) precisely
because that pattern's known failure mode — forgetting to forward a field — is far more dangerous
for `User` than for `Advertisement`/`Taxon`: dropping `passwordHash` or `email` silently breaks
login or notifications, not just a lock-check regression. Since `passwordHash`/`email` are not
mapped properties on `UserProfileUpdate`, the generated `UPDATE` cannot reference them regardless
of builder mistakes — the risk is closed at the type level, not by discipline. See
`user-spring-boot-starter/CLAUDE.md` and
[improvement-024](../backlog/completed/issues/improvement-024-user-save-via-crudrepository.md).

`softDelete` on `Advertisement` and `Taxon` also got the same manual guard (an admin/owner
deleting a listing while someone else is mid-edit should not silently win); `updateMedia`,
`updateLocale`, and `TaxonRepository.restore()` were left unguarded — none of them represent a
user-authored edit that competes with a live form.

The version travels end-to-end: `AdvertisementInfoDto`/`UserDto`/`TaxonDto` (read side, RowMapper
+ SELECT column added where hand-rolled) → `AdvertisementEditDto`/`UserEditDto` (MapStruct maps
the field by name automatically) → `AdvertisementSaveDto`/`UserProfileDto` (write side) →
`TaxonPort.update()`/`softDelete()` and `AdvertisementPort.delete()` gained a trailing `version`
parameter since they had no DTO to carry it (see platform-commons ADR-019).

`AbstractEntityOverlay.handleSave()` gained a `catch (OptimisticLockingFailureException)` before
the generic `catch (Exception)`, showing a dedicated conflict notification
(`*_NOTIFICATION_CONFLICT` i18n keys, one per domain) instead of the generic save-error message.
`SaveConfig` record gained a fourth `conflict` component; `SettingsOverlay` (which has no version
field) passes `null` for it, same as its existing `null` validation/save-error keys.

**Deliberately not done:** no automatic form reload on conflict. Silently replacing the editor's
in-progress form with fresh server data would destroy their unsaved changes without them
noticing — a different flavor of the same "silent data loss" bug this feature exists to fix. The
user sees the conflict notification and must manually cancel/reopen to get a fresh version and
retry — safer than a clever auto-merge for a first version of this feature.

**Consequences:**
- e2e coverage: new test in `04-marketplace-advertisement-flow.spec.js` — two browser contexts
  (`userEn`, `moderatorEn`) open the same advertisement for edit before either saves; the first
  save succeeds, the second (stale) save shows the conflict notification instead of overwriting.

## ADR-030: Field labels applied uniformly across every Activity/Timeline rendering path

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** `AuditTimelineRowRenderer` has two private helpers that both render a list of
`ChangeEntry` into a `Div`: `buildActivityChangesDiv()` (used only when an entity type has an
`AuditActivityFieldsHook` but no `AuditActivityEnrichHook`) and `buildEntityChangesDiv()` (used
by the enrich-hook branch of the cross-entity Timeline, and unconditionally by the overlay
Activity-tab overload `buildActivityFieldsList(AuditActivityItemDto, EntityRef)`). Only the
former applied `labelHook.labelFor(field)` to each `ChangeEntry.FieldChange`; the latter never
did. Since `ADVERTISEMENT` has both hooks registered (`ActivityEnrichHookImpl` for media state,
`AdvertisementActivityFieldsHookImpl` for labels), its enrich-hook branch always won and always
skipped labeling — and every overlay's own Activity tab (Advertisement, User, Taxon,
UserSettings alike) went through `buildEntityChangesDiv()` unconditionally, so it never applied
labels either. The label mappings themselves (`AdvertisementActivityFieldsHookImpl`,
`TaxonActivityFieldsHookImpl`, `UserSettingsActivityFieldsHookImpl`) were already complete —
only the wiring was missing (improvement-013).

**Decision:** `buildEntityChangesDiv()` now takes the resolved `AuditActivityFieldsHook` for the
entity type as a parameter and applies it via a shared `applyLabel(entry, labelHook)` helper
(extracted from the logic `buildActivityChangesDiv()` already had) before rendering each
`FieldChange`. Both call sites — the Timeline enrich-hook branch and the overlay Activity-tab
overload — now resolve `fieldsProviders.get(entityType)` and pass it through. `labelHook` is
nullable-safe (falls back to the raw field key) since `AuditActivityFieldsHook.labelFor()` has a
default no-op implementation, so this doesn't require every entity type to register one.

**Consequences:**
- No changes needed to any `*ActivityFieldsHookImpl` — their `labelFor()` mappings were already
  correct; only `AuditTimelineRowRenderer` needed the wiring fix.
- e2e coverage: `05-seed-filter-sort-pagination.spec.js` — `adminEn changes page sizes...` test
  assertions updated from the old raw-field-name-tolerant regex (`/adsPageSize|Оголошень/i`) to
  the actual humanized label (`/Ads per page|Оголошень/i`), which now proves the fix rather than
  merely tolerating the old bug.

## ADR-031: QuillEditor character counter measures visible text; DB column sized to the raw-HTML cap, not the visible-text cap

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** `QuillEditor` had no visible character counter, unlike Vaadin's `TextArea`/`TextField`
which show one automatically when `maxLength` is set (improvement-006). Separately,
`advertisement.description` was still `TEXT` (unbounded) in the schema, with no DB-level cap
matching the two limits already established in ADR-024: `DESCRIPTION_MAX_LENGTH = 2000`
(visible text, Jsoup-measured) and `DESCRIPTION_RAW_MAX_LENGTH = 20_000` (raw HTML, Bean
Validation `@Size`).

**Decision:**
1. `QuillEditor` gained a `setMaxLength(int)` method (sets a `maxlength` attribute, mirrored in
   `quill-editor.js` via `observedAttributes`). The counter reads `quill.getText().length - 1`
   (Quill's `getText()` always ends in `\n`) on every `text-change`, displaying `"N / max"` —
   this measures the same thing the server does (visible text), not raw HTML size.
   `AdvertisementFormOverlayModeHandler` wires it with
   `descriptionField.setMaxLength(AdvertisementSaveDto.DESCRIPTION_MAX_LENGTH)` (2000).
2. `advertisement.description` changed from `TEXT` to `VARCHAR(20000)` — edited directly into
   the existing `01-advertisement-schema.xml` changeset (DB not yet in production, same
   rationale as prior direct-edit changes this cycle).

**Why the DB column is 20000, not 2000:** the column stores raw HTML (with formatting tags),
not visible text. A description at exactly the 2000-visible-character limit that uses bold,
lists, or headers can easily produce well over 2000 raw characters — legitimate content that
already passes both the UI counter and the server-side Jsoup check. Capping the column at 2000
(matching only the visible-text limit) would reject that already-valid content at the DB layer
for no reason connected to any actual limit anyone agreed to. `20000` reuses the raw-size
ceiling already established and enforced in ADR-024 (`DESCRIPTION_RAW_MAX_LENGTH`) — not a new
number, just the column matching a limit the application already enforces one layer up.

**Consequences:**
- No change to `DESCRIPTION_MAX_LENGTH` (2000) — the visible-text limit users actually see and
  are validated against is unchanged.
- Full e2e suite 48/48 green; counter visually confirmed via Playwright screenshot
  (`adv-useren-create-form-filled`, showing "85 / 2000").

## ADR-032: Request correlation id via SLF4J MDC, plus closing silent-service logging gaps

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Log lines from a single HTTP request/UI action carried no shared identifier —
reconstructing "everything that happened for one save click" across threads meant matching on
timestamps and guessing. `Advertisement.version`/`User.version`/`Taxon.version`
(improvement-015) were considered and rejected as a substitute: a version is unique only within
one row, many requests touch zero or several entities, and a failed/conflicting request has no
version to log against at all (improvement-023).

Separately, a review of `log.` coverage across all services found several completely silent
classes — mutating operations with no log line at all, which would leave the new correlation id
with nothing to correlate: `TaxonService` (create/update/softDelete/restore), `AuthService`
(login/logout — a security-relevant gap), `AttachmentService` (upload/delete/addVideo/
softDeleteAll), `TaxonAssignmentService` (assign/unassign/replaceAssignments),
`AttachmentSnapshotService` (captureAndGetId), `UserSettingsService` (save),
`AdvertisementSaveService` (the marketplace-app-level save transaction, distinct from
`AdvertisementService.save()` which already logged), and both cleanup services
(`AuditCleanupService`/`AdvertisementService.cleanup()`, which discarded the deleted-row count).
`LoginDialog` also lacked the generic catch-all exception log that `SignUpDialog` already had.

**Decision:**
1. `RequestCorrelationFilter` (`marketplace-app/config`, extends `OncePerRequestFilter`) puts a
   fresh `UUID.randomUUID()` in MDC under key `requestId` at the start of every HTTP request,
   removed in a `finally` block. Auto-registered by Spring Boot (any `Filter` bean); no
   `SecurityConfig` changes needed.
2. `application.yml`'s console logging pattern gained `%.8X{requestId}` (first 8 hex chars —
   enough to eyeball-correlate without cluttering the console with a full UUID).
3. Alternative considered: `micrometer-tracing` (auto-configured MDC insertion, full
   distributed-tracing spans) — rejected as heavier than needed for a single-instance monolith
   with no downstream services to trace across; revisit if the app ever splits into multiple
   services.
4. Added `log.info`/`log.warn` to every silent mutating method listed above, following the
   existing convention (`"<Entity> <action>: id={}"`). `deleteOlderThan()` in both
   `AuditLogRepository` and `AdvertisementRepository` changed from `void` to `int` (returns the
   JDBC update count) so cleanup services can log how many rows were actually deleted, not just
   that cleanup ran.

**Vaadin-specific caveat:** a single Vaadin UI session spans many HTTP requests (one per server
round-trip), so `requestId` correlates *one round-trip* (e.g. one save-click), not "the whole
time the user had the form open" — that's expected and matches the actual unit anyone wants to
correlate.

**Consequences:**
- Purely additive: no schema changes, no port/hook signature changes except the two
  `deleteOlderThan()` return-type widenings (both had exactly one caller each, both updated).
- Verified end-to-end: `docker logs` shows a distinct `requestId` per login request during the
  e2e run (e.g. `[d96a341c]`, `[121b21da]`, one per HTTP round-trip).
- Full e2e suite 48/48 green.

## ADR-033: Optional-port UI components use `ComponentFactory<Port>`, never `@ConditionalOnBean` on the component class

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** `AttachmentGalleryService`, `AttachmentGallery`, and `AuditActivityPanel` inject
`AttachmentPort`/`AuditPort` directly as hard constructor parameters. In a genuinely optional
future starter (payment-, telegram-, ai-spring-boot-starter per the roadmap), this would crash
Spring bean construction the moment the starter is removed from the classpath. improvement-011
proposed adding `@ConditionalOnBean(AttachmentPort.class)` / `@ConditionalOnBean(AuditPort.class)`
directly on these three `@SpringComponent` classes so the bean definition itself would not exist
when the port is unavailable ("Option A/C").

This was implemented, deployed, and **empirically broke the app** even with every starter present
and every port genuinely available: the full Playwright e2e suite went from 48/48 to 5 failed / 35
skipped. Root cause, confirmed via container logs and source inspection: `@ConditionalOnBean` on a
`@ComponentScan`-discovered class evaluates during regular bean-definition registration, which
happens *before* `@AutoConfiguration` classes register their beans (`AuditPort`'s real
implementation, `DefaultAuditPort`, is registered by `AuditAutoConfiguration`, an autoconfiguration
class). At the point Spring evaluates the condition for `AuditActivityPanel`, `AuditPort`'s bean
definition does not exist yet — the condition fails, `AuditActivityPanel` is silently never
registered, and `SettingsFormModeHandler.activate()`'s `auditActivityPanelFactory.findIfAvailable()`
guard (line 119) silently omits the Activity tab with no exception. The very first e2e test
(admin sign-up, settings check) failed on that missing tab; because that spec file runs in serial
mode, every later test in the file was skipped, and several e2e users were never created — causing
a cascade of unrelated-looking "Invalid email or password" failures in later spec files that
merely tried to log in as those never-created users. One bug looked like five.

**Decision:** `@ConditionalOnBean` must never be used on a `@ComponentScan`-discovered UI component
class (marketplace-app) that depends on a bean registered by a starter's `@AutoConfiguration`
class — the ordering is not guaranteed and the failure mode is silent (no exception, just an
absent tab/feature). Reverted all three `@ConditionalOnBean` additions. Instead, applied the
already-established pattern from `marketplace-app/CLAUDE.md` ("Use `ComponentFactory<T>` for
optional singleton services/ports"):
- `AuditActivityPanel`: hard field `AuditPort auditPort` → `ComponentFactory<AuditPort>
  auditPortFactory`, resolved via `.get()` inside `configure()`.
- `AttachmentGalleryService` / `AttachmentGallery`: hard field `AttachmentPort attachmentPort` →
  `ComponentFactory<AttachmentPort> attachmentPortFactory`; `AttachmentGallery` resolves it once in
  `@PostConstruct init()` into a cached field (kept the rest of its ~15 call sites unchanged).
  `ObjectProvider<T>` (which `ComponentFactory<T>` wraps) is always injectable regardless of
  whether a `T` bean exists — Spring never fails constructor injection on it, deferring the
  "is it actually there" check to whenever `.get()`/`.ifAvailable()`/`.findIfAvailable()` is
  actually called.
- The *availability gate* moved up one level, from checking the wrapping UI component's factory to
  checking the **port's own** `ComponentFactory` — because once the component classes above no
  longer carry `@ConditionalOnBean`, their own `UiComponentFactory<X>.findIfAvailable()` would
  always resolve non-empty regardless of whether the port truly exists, silently defeating
  graceful degradation. Fixed in every call site that previously gated on the wrapping factory:
  `SettingsFormModeHandler`, `UserFormOverlayModeHandler`, `TaxonFormOverlayModeHandler` (gate
  changed from `auditActivityPanelFactory.findIfAvailable()` to `auditPortFactory.findIfAvailable()`
  — `auditPortFactory` already existed as a field in all three, just unused for this purpose), and
  `AdvertisementFormOverlayModeHandler`, `AdvertisementViewOverlayModeHandler`,
  `AdvertisementCardView` (gate changed from `galleryServiceFactory.ifAvailable(...)` to a new
  `ComponentFactory<AttachmentPort> attachmentPortFactory` field's `.ifAvailable(...)`/
  `.findIfAvailable()`).

**Consequences:**
- No `@ConditionalOnBean` remains on any marketplace-app UI component class targeting a
  starter-provided port — establishes the pattern for future genuinely-optional starters.
- Two pre-existing instances of the *same* wrong-level gate (`auditActivityPanelFactory
  .findIfAvailable()` instead of `auditPortFactory.findIfAvailable()`) were found and fixed in
  `TaxonFormOverlayModeHandler` and `UserFormOverlayModeHandler` during this pass — they had not
  yet caused a visible failure only because `AuditActivityPanel` had never carried a conditional
  annotation before improvement-011, so `findIfAvailable()` on it always happened to resolve
  correctly by accident, not by design.
- Full e2e suite verified 48/48 green after the corrected fix (was 8/48 with the
  `@ConditionalOnBean` approach).

## ADR-034: No raw cross-starter SQL joins — bulk-lookup port + service-level enrichment; actor-reference columns follow Taxon's naming convention

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** `AdvertisementRepository.findAdvertisementById()`/`findByFilter()` did
`FROM advertisement a LEFT JOIN user_information u ON a.created_by_user_id = u.id`, hardcoding
`user-spring-boot-starter`'s table and column names (`user_information`, `u.name`, `u.email`)
inside `advertisement-spring-boot-starter`. This is a stronger violation of "starters must not
depend on each other" (`.claude/rules.md`) than a Java import: there is no class-level
dependency for ArchUnit (improvement-030) to detect, only a raw SQL string — a rename in
`user-spring-boot-starter` would break `advertisement-spring-boot-starter` at runtime with zero
compile-time warning. Separately, `advertisement`'s actor-reference columns
(`created_by_user_id`/`last_modified_by_user_id`/`deleted_by_user_id`) embedded the word "user"
for no functional reason, unlike `taxon`'s already-established `created_by`/`updated_by`/
`deleted_by` convention (same kind of value — an opaque `User.id` populated via
`AuditorAware<Long>`).

**Decision:** Mirrors the already-completed `TaxonPort.findByIds()` pattern
(improvement-007/015), applied to `UserPort`:
- `UserPort.findByIds(Set<Long>) -> Map<Long, UserDto>` added to `platform-commons`;
  `UserPortImpl.findByIds()` is pure delegation to `UserService.findByIds()`, which calls a new
  `UserRepository.findByIds(Long[])` (`SELECT ... WHERE id = ANY(:ids)`, same shape as the
  existing `findActorNames()`/`findExistingIds()` bulk lookups).
- `AdvertisementRepository` no longer joins `user_information` at all — `findAdvertisementById()`
  and `findByFilter()` select only `advertisement.created_by` (the FK id, still present as a
  plain column). The three dead `ORDER BY` alias entries for `u.id`/`u.name`/`u.email` were
  removed together with the join — verified dead: `AdvertisementSortMeta` only exposes
  `TITLE`/`CREATED_AT`/`UPDATED_AT`, so no UI path ever built a `Sort` reaching those aliases.
- `AdvertisementService.enrichWithActorInfo(ads)` (new, mirrors `enrichWithCategories()` exactly,
  same `ComponentFactory<UserPort>` optional-dependency shape as `ComponentFactory<TaxonPort>`)
  merges `createdByUserName`/`createdByUserEmail` into `AdvertisementInfoDto` after the repository
  call, in `getFiltered()` and `findById()`. `UserPortImpl`/`AdvertisementPortImpl` stay pure
  delegation — the merge logic lives only in the service, per `platform-commons/CLAUDE.md`'s
  `*PortImpl` rule.
- Renamed `advertisement`'s actor-reference columns to match `taxon`: `created_by_user_id` →
  `created_by`, `last_modified_by_user_id` → `updated_by`, `deleted_by_user_id` → `deleted_by`
  (direct edit of `01-advertisement-schema.xml` — DB not yet in production, same practice as
  every prior schema edit — requires `deploy.sh --reset` for the Liquibase checksum). Matching
  Java field renames: `Advertisement.createdByUserId`→`createdBy` (`@CreatedBy`),
  `.lastModifiedByUserId`→`updatedBy` (`@LastModifiedBy`); `AdvertisementInfoDto.createdByUserId`
  (platform-commons) and `AdvertisementEditDto.createdByUserId`/`.lastModifiedByUserId`
  (marketplace-app) renamed to match — `createdByUserName`/`createdByUserEmail` keep their names
  since they describe enrichment output, not a `_user_id`-suffixed column.

**Sort-by-author, if ever requested:** do not reintroduce a JOIN (recreates this exact violation)
and do not sort in memory after `enrichWithActorInfo()` (pagination `LIMIT`/`OFFSET` runs in SQL
*before* enrichment, so an in-memory sort would only order the current page, silently wrong for
any page beyond the first). The correct fix is the same pattern already used for
`media_url`/`media_content_type`: denormalize `created_by_user_name` onto `advertisement`, synced
via a typed hook fired on user name changes — not a query-time join.

**Explicitly not touched:** the FK constraints in `01-advertisement-schema.xml`
(`referencedTableName="user_information"`) still reference the other starter's table by name —
this is a deeper, separate schema-level coupling (referential integrity inherently requires
knowing the referenced table) that this ADR does not attempt to resolve.

**Consequences:**
- Full e2e suite must stay green — the advertisement card's author-email display
  (`AdvertisementCardView.java:187`, `ad.getCreatedByUserEmail()`) and the owner-only edit/delete
  button visibility (`getOwnerUserId()`, used in `AdvertisementCardView`,
  `AdvertisementFormOverlayModeHandler`, `AdvertisementViewOverlayModeHandler`) are the concrete
  regression detectors.

## ADR-035: `advertisement` stores no denormalized attachment columns — media summary enriched at read time via a bulk `AttachmentPort` lookup

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** `advertisement` had three columns — `media_url`, `media_content_type`, `media_count`
— caching a summary of the entity's attachments, written by
`AdvertisementRepository.updateMedia()`, triggered by `MediaChangeHookImpl.onMediaChanged()`
whenever `AttachmentService` fired `AttachmentMediaChangeHook`. An earlier pass on this review
dismissed these columns as "fine as-is" because the sync mechanism (a hook) was clean — that
answered "is the sync mechanism clean?" (yes) instead of "does the coupling exist?" (also yes,
independently of the mechanism): three columns named with attachment-domain vocabulary, living on
`advertisement`'s own row, in a different starter's schema. `backlog/entity-extensions/SPEC.md`
(deleted 2026-07-13) had already named this exact coupling as a motivating problem; its proposed
fix (genericize into a `media JSONB` column) was rejected — re-encoding the same data on the same
row removes type safety without removing the coupling itself.

**Decision:** Same shape as ADR-034 (User) and the completed improvement-007 (Taxon): a bulk
lookup replaces the denormalized cache.
- `AttachmentPort.getMediaSummaries(EntityType, Set<Long>) -> Map<Long, AttachmentMediaSummaryDto>`
  added to `platform-commons`, alongside the existing single-entity `getMediaSummary(EntityRef)`.
  `DefaultAttachmentPort` stays pure delegation to a new `AttachmentService.getMediaSummaries()`,
  which calls a new `AttachmentRepository.loadMediaStats(EntityType, Set<Long>)` — one SQL query
  using `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY entity_id ORDER BY created_at ASC)` to pick each entity's
  earliest attachment as its "main" one, plus `COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY entity_id)`, matching
  the existing single-entity method's semantics exactly (`loadMediaStats(EntityType, Long)`,
  unchanged, still used by the single-entity path).
- `AdvertisementService.enrichWithMediaSummary(ads)` (new, same shape as `enrichWithCategories()`/
  `enrichWithActorInfo()`) merges `mediaUrl`/`mediaContentType`/`mediaCount` into
  `AdvertisementInfoDto` at read time in `getFiltered()`/`findById()`, using the already-existing
  `ComponentFactory<AttachmentPort> attachmentPortFactory` field. Entities with zero attachments
  fall back to `AttachmentMediaSummaryDto.empty()`.
- The three columns were removed from `advertisement` (`01-advertisement-schema.xml`, direct
  edit — DB not yet in production, `deploy.sh --reset` required), along with
  `AdvertisementRepository.updateMedia()` and the three dead `ORDER BY` sort-alias entries for
  them (confirmed unreachable — `AdvertisementSortMeta` never exposed a media-related sort).
- **The write-triggered sync path was deleted entirely, not just emptied**: `MediaChangeHookImpl`
  (the only implementation of `AttachmentMediaChangeHook`), `AdvertisementService
  .onMediaChanged(Long)`, and `AdvertisementPort.onMediaChanged(Long)` (confirmed unused by any
  marketplace-app call site) are all gone — there is nothing left to update once no column caches
  the data. `AttachmentService` still fires `AttachmentMediaChangeHook` on every media change (the
  interface itself stays in `platform-commons` as a generic, still-meaningful extension point for
  any future starter that wants to react to media changes) — it now simply has zero listeners,
  which is the same valid, gracefully-degraded state every other optional SPI in this codebase
  already tolerates.

**Tradeoff accepted explicitly:** one more bulk `AttachmentPort` query per advertisement list
render — the same cost class already accepted twice (Taxon categories, User author info) for the
same real decoupling benefit.

**Consequences:**
- Full e2e suite must stay green — `AdvertisementCardView.java`'s media thumbnail/badge rendering
  (reads `ad.getMediaUrl()`/`getMediaContentType()`/`getMediaCount()`) is the concrete regression
  detector; behavior is unchanged since `AdvertisementInfoDto` still carries these fields, just
  populated by enrichment instead of a stored column.

## ADR-036: `AdvertisementRepository.buildIdClause()` binds a plain array, not a `Set`, for the category-filter id list

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** `AdvertisementService.resolveCategoryFilter()` calls `TaxonPort
.findEntityIdsWithAnyTaxon()` to get the set of advertisement ids matching the selected
categories — the bulk-lookup pattern ADR-034 already established, kept exactly as-is here (not
revisited). The gap was one level down: `AdvertisementRepository.buildIdClause()` bound that
`Set<Long>` directly to `WHERE a.id IN (:allowedIds)`. Spring's `NamedParameterJdbcTemplate`
expands a `Collection`-typed bind value into one `?` placeholder per element for an `IN` clause —
unbounded for a popular category's advertisement count, and the SQL text itself changes shape
(different placeholder count) for every differently-sized result, defeating Postgres's query-plan
cache on top of the parameter-count risk. Filed as improvement-050 item 2.

Three fixes were considered:
1. **Leave as-is** — rejected for a fresh review, but was the standing default for a while: no
   evidence this app's real category sizes are anywhere near the risk zone (current seed/test data
   is ~10 ads/category), and the project avoids designing for hypothetical future load. Revisit
   trigger: a real category size approaching the thousands.
2. **Defensively cap `allowedIds` size** — rejected: silently wrong results (arbitrarily dropping
   matches) or an opaque failure, neither actually fixes the scaling problem, just delays it.
3. **JOIN to `taxon_assignment` directly** — rejected: reverses ADR-034's own decision (no raw
   cross-starter SQL joins) without a compelling reason to, since a much smaller fix closes the
   actual problem without touching that boundary at all (see Decision below).

**Decision:** Bind a plain `Long[]` array instead of the `Set<Long>`, and compare with
`= ANY(:allowedIds)` instead of `IN (:allowedIds)`:
```java
params.addValue("allowedIds", ids.toArray(new Long[0]));
return " AND a.id = ANY(:allowedIds)";
```
Spring only expands `Collection`-typed values into multiple placeholders — a native array is
passed through as a single bind parameter, and the PostgreSQL JDBC driver binds it natively as one
`bigint[]` value. This is not a new pattern: `AdvertisementRepository.findExistingIds(Long[] ids)`
already does exactly this (`WHERE id = ANY(:ids)`) a few lines below `buildIdClause()` — the fix
is applying the class's own existing, already-proven convention consistently, not introducing a
new one.

**Why not `unnest()`:** `WHERE a.id IN (SELECT unnest(:allowedIds))` is a documented, equally valid
alternative for the same underlying reason (a single array bind instead of N placeholders) — not
chosen here only because `= ANY()` was already an established, tested pattern in this exact class,
so it carries less risk than introducing new SQL syntax the codebase hasn't used before.

**On Postgres coupling:** `= ANY()` is Postgres-specific syntax (not ANSI SQL), same as `unnest()`
would have been. Not treated as a new category of risk — this codebase already commits to
Postgres-specific features throughout (`JSONB` columns with `::jsonb` casts, `ROW_NUMBER() OVER
(PARTITION BY ...)`, `(created_at, id) <=` tuple comparisons — see ADR-020 and the audit tiebreak
fix in improvement-050 item 4), and portability to another RDBMS has never been a stated goal.

**On the array-size limit:** binding a native array removes the *parameter-count* limit entirely
(always exactly one bind parameter, regardless of how many ids). A different limit still exists —
PostgreSQL's per-value TOAST size cap (~1 GB) — but for a `bigint[]`, that allows tens of millions
of elements before it would ever matter, several orders of magnitude past any realistic category
size for this app.

**Consequences:**
- `AdvertisementRepository.findByFilter()`/`countByFilter()` — the only two callers of
  `buildIdClause()` — are otherwise unchanged.
- New regression coverage: `AdvertisementRepositoryTest
  .findByFilter_allowedIdsRestrictsToMatchingRows` /
  `.countByFilter_allowedIdsRestrictsCount` — the existing test class had zero coverage of the
  non-null `allowedIds` path before this (every prior test passed `null`).

## ADR-037: Raw `new Button(...)` spots converted to `Ui*Button` wrappers — every consumer is itself a bean injecting its own factory, never a pre-built widget through a constructor

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** `HeaderBar`, `PaginationBar`, the attachment lightbox/gallery family
(`CardMediaLightbox`, `AttachmentLightbox`, `CardLightboxViewer`, `AttachmentThumbnail`,
`AttachmentGallery`), `AuditActivityRowRenderer`'s restore button, and `UserPickerField`'s
clear/open buttons all hand-built raw `Button`/`ButtonVariant` calls instead of reusing the
existing `UiPrimaryButton`/`UiTertiaryButton`/`UiIconButton` wrappers — five of these spots applied
**no theme variant at all** (a real visible UX bug in the header's 4 auth buttons, not just
duplication). Filed as improvement-026.

**Design question that came up mid-implementation:** how should a plain (non-Spring) helper class
obtain a `Ui*Button` instance? Two designs were tried and rejected before landing on the final
one:
1. Pass a `UiComponentFactory<UiIconButton>` into a plain class's constructor — rejected: a
   Spring factory has no business being injected into a class the container doesn't manage.
2. Pass a pre-built `Ui*Button` widget into the constructor (asymmetric: some call sites via
   constructor, others via a static `open()` factory method) — rejected: inconsistent construction
   shape across sibling classes, and passing *views* into a constructor is backwards regardless —
   constructors should receive **beans**, not pre-built widgets.

A full-tree survey (every class anywhere that consumes a `Ui*Button`/`*ActionButton` type) found
**zero exceptions** to one pattern: the consumer is always itself a real `@SpringComponent
@Scope("prototype")` bean, and it injects its own `UiComponentFactory<T>` directly.

**Decision:** Apply that same pattern everywhere raw buttons were converted. Where a plain class
didn't already carry Spring wiring (`AttachmentLightbox`, `CardLightboxViewer`,
`AttachmentThumbnail` — previously plain classes or partially so), it was promoted to a full
`@SpringComponent @Scope("prototype")` bean specifically so it could inject
`UiComponentFactory<UiIconButton>` itself, matching every other consumer in the codebase. Done in
four phased batches (full e2e run after each, per the project's established discipline for
wide-blast-radius UI refactors):
1. **`HeaderBar`** — 4 auth buttons → `UiPrimaryButton`, all CSS classes (`header-*-button`)
   preserved exactly — these are selected by nearly every Playwright spec's login-check.
2. **`PaginationBar`** — 4 nav icon buttons → `UiIconButton`.
3. **Attachment lightboxes/gallery** — `CardMediaLightbox`, `AttachmentLightbox`,
   `CardLightboxViewer`, `AttachmentThumbnail` all promoted to beans as described above; new
   `ATTACHMENT_LIGHTBOX_*_TOOLTIP` i18n keys added (these buttons previously had no tooltip at
   all).
4. **`AuditActivityRowRenderer`**'s restore button → `UiTertiaryButton` + `.addThemeVariants
   (LUMO_SMALL)` layered on top (the established "wrapper + one extra variant" technique, same as
   `ConfirmActionDialog`'s `LUMO_ERROR` layering); `UserPickerField`'s clear/open buttons →
   `UiIconButton`, with two new tooltip keys (`USER_PICKER_CLEAR_TOOLTIP`/`_OPEN_TOOLTIP`) since
   neither button had one before.

**Deliberately excluded, each for a documented reason:**
- `query/elements/action/QueryActionButton.java` — a legitimate sibling wrapper (its own
  `Configurable` component, SVG icons, `ButtonVariant` passed as an explicit parameter) used only
  by `QueryActionBlock`. Architecturally inconsistent with the `Ui*Button` family
  (variant-as-parameter vs. variant-hardcoded-per-class) but that's a design-unification question,
  not raw-`Button` duplication.
- `services/NotificationService.java`'s close button — a plain `@Service`, not a Vaadin bean, with
  a raw Lumo font glyph icon (not `VaadinIcon`); converting would mean a non-UI-scoped service
  reaching into `UiComponentFactory` machinery and would visibly change the rendered icon, not a
  pure refactor. Extracted to its own decision issue:
  [improvement-057](../backlog/issues/improvement-057-notificationservice-close-button-decision.md).
- `UserPickerField`'s inline search button (a `TextField` suffix component using
  `LUMO_TERTIARY_INLINE`, a variant `UiIconButton` doesn't support) — forcing it through
  `UiIconButton`'s hardcoded `LUMO_TERTIARY+LUMO_ICON` baseline risked a visual regression for zero
  UX benefit. Extracted, along with an unrelated pagination-correctness bug found in the same file
  while scoping this batch, to
  [improvement-056](../backlog/issues/improvement-056-userpickerfield-inline-button-gap-and-pagination-bug.md).
- `AttachmentUploadButton` — wraps Vaadin's `Upload` component, a materially different widget, not
  a `Button` at all.

**Regression found and fixed along the way:** adding a real tooltip to `UserPickerField`'s clear
button (previously it had none) broke a shared Playwright helper,
`e2e/_flows/filter.flow.js`'s `clearFilter()`/`applyFilter()` — both used
`${blockSelector} vaadin-button[title*="Clear"/"Apply"]`, a selector scoped to the whole query
block, not just the block's own Apply/Clear buttons. Once the picker's clear button also carried a
"Clear"-containing title, the selector matched two elements (strict-mode violation) inside
`TimelineQueryBlock` specifically (the only query block that embeds a `UserPickerField`). Fixed by
scoping both helpers to `.query-action-block` — the CSS class `QueryActionBlock` already applies to
itself around its own Apply/Clear buttons — rather than the wider block selector.

**Consequences:**
- All four batches verified independently with a full `deploy.sh` + `bash scripts/playwright.sh
  e2e --full --ux` run — 48/48 green each time.
- `marketplace-app/CLAUDE.md`'s "Configurable prototype beans" pattern now has three more
  real-world instances of the "promote a plain class to a bean solely to inject a `UiComponentFactory`"
  shape — if [improvement-025](../backlog/issues/improvement-025-leaf-ui-components-plain-classes.md)
  (leaf widgets → plain classes) is picked up later, these three new beans
  (`AttachmentLightbox`/`CardLightboxViewer`/`AttachmentThumbnail`) become new candidates for
  reverting back to plain classes once `UiIconButton` itself stops being a Spring bean — flagged
  directly in that issue's own investigation notes, not lost.

## ADR-038: Theme CSS colors tokenized into named custom properties — fixes the WCAG AA contrast failure and builds the prerequisite dark-mode needs

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** `marketplace-app/src/main/frontend/themes/my-app/` (21 CSS files) used hardcoded hex
color literals throughout — 49 unique values, ~180 occurrences, the same handful of colors
copy-pasted into 9-15 different files each, zero `:root`/custom-property infrastructure. Two
concrete problems, filed as improvement-037 (accessibility) and improvement-039 (dark mode):
1. `.header-auth-row span` used `#94a3b8` (~2.5:1 contrast on white) — fails WCAG AA's 4.5:1
   minimum for body text.
2. Dark mode is structurally impossible without a token layer — Lumo ships a dark palette, but
   only components already using `var(--lumo-*)`/custom-property tokens pick it up automatically;
   swapping 180 hardcoded literals in place isn't a real option.

Both issues' own text called out that they share the exact same prerequisite (hardcoded hex →
named tokens) and recommended doing both in one pass over the theme files rather than two separate
touches of the same CSS. improvement-039's actual dark-mode toggle (`prefers-color-scheme` +
switcher UI) is explicitly deferred to a later pass — this ADR covers only the token
infrastructure + the accessibility fix riding on top of it.

**Decision:** Every hex value was named as a semantic custom property in a new `:root` block in
`styles.css` (`--app-*` prefix, to stay visually distinct from Lumo's own `--lumo-*` tokens), then
every occurrence across all 21 files was replaced with `var(--app-*)`. Values map almost exactly
onto Tailwind's default palette (`#94a3b8` = slate-400, `#3b82f6` = blue-500, etc.) — not a
coincidence, the app's colors were already implicitly drawn from that palette; tokenizing just
gives the existing (if undocumented) design system real names instead of inventing a new one.

Token groups, by role (full list with inline comments: `styles.css` lines 41-118):
- **Text** (`--app-text-primary/-secondary/-tertiary/-muted`) — 4-tier slate text hierarchy.
- **Borders/surfaces** (`--app-border-*`, `--app-surface-*`) — dividers, card/page backgrounds.
- **Primary accent** (`--app-accent-primary*`, 10 shades) — the blue family: links, focus
  outlines, query-block chrome, active tab.
- **Gallery accent** (`--app-accent-gallery*`, 6 shades) — indigo, `attachment-gallery.css` only.
- **Violet accent** (`--app-accent-violet*`) — the `USER_SETTINGS` activity-type badge and one
  card gradient partner.
- **Status colors** — separate bg/text token pairs per badge kind: success (created action,
  active user role), info (updated action, reuses `--app-accent-primary-bg`), the
  `advertisement` entity-type pill, restored action, moderator role, danger (deleted action).

**The WCAG fix, specifically:** `--app-text-muted` is defined as `#64748b` (the color that was
*already* used, and already measured ~4.76:1 — passes AA with margin) and now serves **both** the
former `#64748b` call sites and the former `#94a3b8` (failing) call sites — the two were
functionally the same "de-emphasized text" role, just drifted to two different grays over time.
Merging them into one compliant value is not a workaround; it's the actual fix — you cannot keep a
visually-distinct "extra light" gray tier that also passes 4.5:1, `#94a3b8` was failing precisely
*because* it was lighter than the compliant tier. This was the **only** value intentionally
changed during tokenization — every other token preserves its exact prior hex value, so the rest
of this refactor has zero visual delta by construction.

**RGB-triplet companion tokens:** three colors (`--app-accent-primary`, `--app-status-warning-accent`,
`--app-status-danger-outline`) also appeared as `rgba(r,g,b,alpha)` literals for shadow/highlight
glows (`highlight.css`, query-block focus rings). Added `--app-accent-primary-rgb: 59, 130, 246`-style
companions (raw comma-separated channels, since `var()` can't extract channels out of a hex
custom property) so those `rgba()` calls became `rgba(var(--app-accent-primary-rgb), 0.07)` instead
of a second, disconnected copy of the same color.

**Deliberately left as literals (documented scope boundary, not an oversight):**
- Pure black/white shadow and overlay alphas (`rgba(0,0,0,0.04)` box-shadows,
  `rgba(0,0,0,0.92)` lightbox backdrop, `rgba(255,255,255,0.15)` lightbox control hover) — these
  are an elevation/shadow system, not brand colors; tokenizing two dozen distinct one-off alpha
  values (each hand-tuned for a specific shadow depth) would add indirection with no reuse value.
  Revisit only if/when the dark-mode toggle actually ships and shadows need to invert.
- `query-block.css:22`'s `rgba(239, 246, 255, 0.9)` — a near-white tint close to but not identical
  to `--app-accent-primary-bg-hover`, single occurrence, not worth a dedicated token.

**Consequences:**
- `styles.css`'s `:root` block is now the single source of truth for every brand/status color in
  the app — changing a color means editing one line, not grep-and-replace across up to 15 files.
- improvement-039 (dark mode) is now unblocked at the infrastructure level: a dark palette is a
  second `:root` (or `[data-theme="dark"]`) block redefining the same custom-property names — no
  further CSS file touches required for the color layer itself.
- Verified via full `deploy.sh` + `bash scripts/playwright.sh e2e --full --ux` — a pure CSS-value
  substitution carries no logic-level regression risk, but the file count (21) and occurrence
  count (~180) made a full visual smoke pass worth doing rather than assuming.
- improvement-037's two remaining items (not part of the tokenization itself, done as a follow-up
  in the same pass) — `UiIconButton.configure()` now sets `aria-label` alongside `title` (an
  icon-only button's `title` attribute alone isn't a reliably announced accessible name across
  screen readers), which fixes every icon-only button app-wide in one shared-component edit
  (lightbox prev/next/close, pagination nav, attachment-thumbnail delete, `UserPickerField`
  clear/open) rather than per-call-site; the category chip list
  (`AdvertisementViewOverlayModeHandler`) got `role="list"`/`role="listitem"` +
  `aria-label` for correct screen-reader grouping (no "city chips" exist in the codebase yet — that
  feature is still on the private roadmap, nothing to fix there); a `.primary-button/.tertiary-button
  /.icon-button:focus-visible` rule was added to `styles.css`, matching the pre-existing
  `.advertisement-card:focus-visible` treatment, since no explicit focus style existed for the
  `Ui*Button` family before. Full e2e suite re-verified 48/48 after these additions.

## ADR-039: Maven Enforcer — dependency hygiene enforced at build time, starter-to-starter ban activated per-starter not at the root

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Several dependency-hygiene rules were convention-only, checked by human review: no
direct starter→starter Maven dependencies (the module import rule from `.claude/rules.md`), no
guard against conflicting transitive dependency versions across the reactor, no enforced minimum
Java/Maven version at build time. Filed as improvement-031.

**Decision:**
- Root `pom.xml`: `maven-enforcer-plugin` added to an active `<build><plugins>` block (inherited by
  every module) with `dependencyConvergence`, `requireJavaVersion` (`[25,)`), and
  `requireMavenVersion` (`[3.9,)`).
- The starter→starter ban (`bannedDependencies`) is **not** in the root's active plugins — a
  project-wide ban would also apply to `marketplace-app`/`integration-tests`, which legitimately
  depend on starters. Instead, each of the 5 starter poms
  (`audit-`/`attachment-`/`user-`/`advertisement-`/`taxon-spring-boot-starter`) activates the same
  rule individually in its own `<build><plugins>`, banning the other 4 starter artifacts.

**Found and fixed while turning this on (not just theoretical):**
1. `advertisement-spring-boot-starter/pom.xml` declared `audit-spring-boot-starter` and
   `attachment-spring-boot-starter` as `<optional>true</optional>` Maven dependencies with **zero**
   Java source anywhere in the module importing from either (`org.ost.audit.*`/`org.ost.attachment.*`
   — confirmed via full-module grep before removing). Vestigial cruft, removed; all real
   cross-starter wiring already went through `platform-commons`' SPI types via `ComponentFactory<T>`,
   which needed no Maven dependency at all.
2. `dependencyConvergence` immediately caught a real, previously invisible conflict:
   `liquibase-core:5.0.2` depends on `commons-text:1.15.0` directly, and also on
   `opencsv:5.12.0` → `commons-text:1.13.1` transitively — two versions of the same artifact
   resolving inconsistently depending on classpath order. Pinned to `1.15.0` (matching
   liquibase-core's own direct requirement) in the root `dependencyManagement`.

**Follow-up (2026-07-16, improvement-059):** the same rule caught a second, equivalent
`commons-io` conflict once something actually ran `mvn -pl integration-tests test` for the first
time (`testcontainers`'s transitive `2.20.0` vs. `liquibase-core`'s transitive `2.21.0`) —
`liquibase-core` bumped to `5.0.3` (from `5.0.2` above) and `commons-io` pinned to `2.22.0` to
match. Full rationale in `scripts/ci/DECISIONS.md` ADR-001.

**Consequences:**
- A future starter→starter Maven dependency (optional or not) now fails the build immediately,
  not just a code-review catch.
- Verified via full `deploy.sh --no-cache` (all 5 starters + marketplace-app rebuild from empty
  cache, exercising every enforcer rule) + `bash scripts/playwright.sh e2e --full --ux`, 48/48.

## ADR-040: `NotificationService`'s close button converted to `UiIconButton` despite being a plain `@Service`, not a Vaadin bean

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** `NotificationService.createLayout()`'s close button was the one raw-`Button` spot
improvement-026 deliberately excluded from its mechanical conversion, because
`NotificationService` is a plain `@Service` (not a `@SpringComponent` Vaadin bean like every other
`Ui*Button` consumer) and its icon was a raw Lumo font glyph (`new Icon("lumo", "cross")`, not
`VaadinIcon`) — a conversion would be a small visible icon change, not a pure refactor. Filed as
improvement-057 to decide explicitly rather than leave unresolved.

**Decision:** Convert anyway, in favor of full consistency over the narrow exception. Neither
concern held up as a real blocker on inspection:
- No rule in this codebase (`.claude/rules.md`, `platform-commons/CLAUDE.md`) forbids a `@Service`
  from depending on `UiComponentFactory<T>` — it simply hadn't been done before.
  `NotificationService` already lives in the UI-layer package (`ui.views.services`), so a
  singleton service reaching into `UiComponentFactory<UiIconButton>` (itself backed by
  `ObjectProvider<UiIconButton>`, exactly the mechanism Spring provides for a singleton to obtain
  fresh prototype-scoped instances) is architecturally unremarkable, not a scope violation.
- The icon swap (Lumo glyph → `VaadinIcon.CLOSE_SMALL`) is visually negligible — an "X" in either
  icon set — and now every icon-only button in the app renders through the same wrapper, with no
  documented exception for a future `improvement-030` (ArchUnit) rule to special-case.

New `NOTIFICATION_CLOSE_TOOLTIP` i18n key added (the raw glyph never had a tooltip/aria-label
before; `UiIconButton.configure()` now sets both `title` and `aria-label` per ADR-037's
improvement-037 follow-up).

**Follow-up fix (2026-07-16, found via direct visual screenshot inspection, not caught by any
Playwright assertion):** `UiIconButton`'s default tertiary-theme icon color is Lumo's primary
blue (`rgb(0, 95, 219)`) — correct on the white/neutral surfaces every other `UiIconButton`
consumer renders on, but wrong here: `Notification`'s `LUMO_ERROR`/`LUMO_SUCCESS` variants render
white text (`rgb(255, 255, 255)`, confirmed via computed-style inspection) on red/green
backgrounds, so the close icon rendered as a mismatched blue glyph on a colored background.
Added `.notification-close-btn { color: var(--app-surface-white); }` in a new
`notification.css` (the `notification-*` CSS classes had no theme file at all before this —
purely inline/inherited styling). Confirmed visually via direct screenshot before and after.

**Consequences:**
- Zero remaining raw `new Button(...)` spots from the original improvement-026 audit — every
  identified spot is now either converted or explicitly, permanently out of scope
  (`QueryActionButton`, `AttachmentUploadButton` — see improvement-026's own "Do NOT touch" list).
- Verified via full `deploy.sh` + `bash scripts/playwright.sh e2e --full --ux`, 48/48 — the two
  existing Playwright selectors touching the notification close button
  (`e2e/_helpers.js`'s `closeNotification()`, `_flows/category.flow.js`) both use the generic
  `vaadin-notification-card vaadin-button` pattern, unaffected by the icon/class change.

## ADR-041: ArchUnit codifies cross-module architecture rules — lives in `marketplace-app/src/test`, not a new module

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Every cross-module and intra-module architecture rule in this project (module import
restrictions, no-Vaadin-in-starters, Port/Hook placement, `@PreAuthorize` placement, `Optional`-
parameter ban, `config` vs `configuration` naming, `*PortImpl`/`*HookImpl` delegation-only) lived
as prose in `CLAUDE.md`/`rules.md`, checked by human review only. Two real violations
(improvement-011's unguarded port injection, improvement-010's view deviating from its own
`refresh()` pattern) reached working code before being caught by manual audit rather than a build
failure.

**Decision:** Added ArchUnit (`com.tngtech.archunit:archunit-junit5:1.4.2`, test-scope) directly to
`marketplace-app`'s existing test tree — `marketplace-app/src/test/java/org/ost/marketplace/
architecture/ArchitectureRulesTest.java` — rather than a new dedicated module. `marketplace-app`
already depends on every starter + `platform-commons` + `query-lib` (confirmed directly), so its
test classpath already has every compiled class ArchUnit needs to check cross-module rules (e.g.
"no Vaadin in starters" needs starter classes; "UI must not call repositories directly" needs
marketplace-app's own `ui` package) — no new module, no new dependency wiring. This also means
these checks run automatically as part of the existing `scripts/unit-tests.sh`/`scripts/ci.sh
--unit` stage, with zero new script/CI plumbing.

Seven rules implemented, mapping directly to the seven prose rules identified in improvement-030:
UI-must-not-call-repositories, no-Vaadin-in-starters, Ports/Hooks-live-only-in-platform-commons
(split into two separate rules, one per suffix, rather than one combined `.or()` rule — simpler
and less error-prone than chaining ArchUnit's fluent predicate combinators), no-class-level-
`@PreAuthorize`-on-services, no-`Optional`-method-parameters (a custom `ArchCondition` — ArchUnit
has no built-in predicate for this), no-`configuration`-packages, and `*PortImpl`/`*HookImpl`-
delegation-only (no `java.util.stream`/Jackson dependencies).

**The delegation-only rule needed no explicit exception list for `DefaultTaxonPort`/
`DefaultAuditPort`/`DefaultAttachmentPort`** (all three are documented, deliberate
coordination-layer exceptions — see e.g. `taxon-spring-boot-starter/CLAUDE.md`, and `DefaultTaxonPort`
does genuinely import `java.util.stream.Collectors`) — the rule only targets the `*PortImpl`/
`*HookImpl` simple-name suffix, and none of the three `Default*Port`-named classes match that
suffix. The existing `Default*Port` vs. `*PortImpl` naming convention
(`platform-commons/CLAUDE.md` "Hook and Port Implementation Rules") already draws exactly the
line this rule needs, for free.

**Consequences:**
- All 7 rules (8 `@ArchTest` fields — Port/Hook split into two) pass cleanly against the current
  codebase on first run — the rules describe discipline already actually followed, now enforced by
  a build failure instead of a code-review judgment call. Verified via `bash scripts/unit-tests.sh
  ArchitectureRulesTest` (8/8 passed) and a full `bash scripts/unit-tests.sh` run (all suites still
  green) to confirm the new test-scope dependency didn't disturb anything else.

## ADR-042: `UserPickerField` gains an offset-based lookup (`OffsetPageable`) instead of deriving a page number from Vaadin's raw offset

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** `UserPickerField` is the only place in `marketplace-app` using Vaadin's native lazy
`CallbackDataProvider`/`DataProvider.fromFilteringCallbacks` — every other grid uses the app's own
`PaginationBar` with explicit page-state tracking. Its data provider derived a page number from
Vaadin's raw row offset via `query.getOffset() / query.getLimit()`, which is only correct when the
offset happens to be an exact multiple of the limit — not guaranteed by Vaadin's `Grid`/
`DataCommunicator` under fast/jump scrolling. A non-page-aligned fetch (e.g. `offset=137,
limit=50`) silently computed the wrong page, returning duplicated, skipped, or wrong rows. Went
untriggered by existing Playwright coverage because the seed spec used exactly 50 users, matching
Vaadin `Grid`'s default page size — the entire result set fit in one always-aligned fetch
(`offset=0`). Filed as improvement-056 alongside a related, smaller gap: the picker's inline
search button used a raw `Button` instead of `UiIconButton`, since `UiIconButton` had no variant
for Vaadin's `LUMO_TERTIARY_INLINE` (the suffix/prefix-slot button treatment).

**Decision:**
- Added `OffsetPageable` (`query-lib/src/main/java/org/ost/query/sort/OffsetPageable.java`) — a
  `record` implementing Spring Data's `Pageable` directly, carrying an arbitrary raw `offset`
  instead of deriving `offset = page * size` the way `PageRequest.of(page, size)` always does.
  Chosen over reworking `UserPort.getFiltered()`'s existing page-based contract (used by every
  `PaginationBar`-style caller) — introducing a second, offset-shaped `Pageable` implementation
  is additive and keeps the page-based contract untouched for its existing callers.
- Added `UserPort.getFilteredByOffset(filter, offset, limit, sort)`, delegating through
  `UserPortImpl` → `UserService.getFilteredByOffset()` → `UserRepository.findByFilter(filter, new
  OffsetPageable(offset, limit, sort))`. The repository itself needed **no changes** — its SQL
  already used `pageable.getOffset()` (via `PaginationSqlBuilder.pageLimit()` →
  `LIMIT :limit OFFSET :offset`), so it was already offset-correct; only the `Pageable` it
  received was wrong.
- `UserPickerField`'s data provider now calls `userPort.getFilteredByOffset(filter,
  query.getOffset(), query.getLimit(), sort)` directly — no more `offset/limit` division.
- `UiIconButton.Parameters` gained a `boolean inline` field (default `false`); `configure()` now
  applies `LUMO_TERTIARY_INLINE` instead of `LUMO_TERTIARY` when `inline` is set, moved out of
  `init()` (which previously hardcoded the non-inline variant unconditionally). The picker's
  search button now goes through `UiIconButton` with `inline(true)`.

**Verification:** the existing Playwright seed volume (50 users) could never have exercised the
bug (see Context) — bumped `05-seed-filter-sort-pagination.spec.js`'s `SEED_COUNT` from 50 to 60
specifically so the picker's underlying grid needs a second Vaadin-internal data-provider page,
and retargeted the timeline actor-filter test to pick a name-sorted user past the first page
(`'Seed User 60'` instead of `adminEn`, who previously sorted within the first page and never
exercised the bug either). `fillActorPicker` in `timeline.flow.js` gained a grid-scroll step
(`grid.scrollToIndex(...)`) to actually reach that row. Full `bash scripts/playwright.sh e2e --full
--ux` run: 48/48 passed, confirming both the fix and that the seed-count bump didn't regress any
existing pagination assertion (`verifyPagination()`'s hardcoded 3-page structure, `1-20`/`21-40`/
`41-{total}`, holds for 60 exactly as cleanly as for 50 — 60 divides evenly into three full pages
of 20 rather than 50's partial third page of 10).

**Consequences:**
- `OffsetPageable` is a new, general-purpose `query-lib` type available to any future caller that
  needs to pass a Vaadin-native (or otherwise raw) offset through to a `Pageable`-based repository
  method without page-number derivation.
